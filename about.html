	<h3>9/13/16</h3>
<p>For this assignment, I decided to keep a record of everything I listened to in one day. The particular day illustrated in this diary was Monday the 12th. My music taste is never consistant, and I think that the music I listen to is definitely effected by whatever mood i'm in throughout the day, what activities i'm doing, or who I am with. To create my diary I just embedded spotify albums or songs using iframes. </p>
